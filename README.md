# Optimizing Ride-Sharing Performance & Customer Experience

Uncovering key insights into user behaviour, driver performance, and operational bottlenecks. This will allow the ride share platform to make data-driven decisions that drive growth and efficiency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## 1. KPI Metrics

| KPI                       | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Total Revenue**         | $600,938.35   |
| **Average Customer Rating** | 3.73        |
| **Average Ride Duration** | 54.03 minutes |
| **No-Show Rate**          | 5%            |
| **Total Rides Completed** | 8,495         |

## 2. Customer Behavior & Preferences

* **Popular Pickup and Drop-off Locations**  
Most trips move between the Suburbs and the Financial District, showing a clear commuter pattern. Local travel within the Suburbs is also common, while mall-related trips occur less often.

* **Weekends vs. Weekdays Ride Demand**  
Ride activity is heavily tied to the workweek. Weekdays carry most of the volume, and weekends fall off sharply, pointing to a commuter-driven customer base.

* **Most Preferred Vehicle Types**  
Sedans and SUVs handle most of the demand. Other vehicle types see lighter use and serve more specific needs rather than broad rider preference.

## 3. Driver Performance & Efficiency

* **Highest and Lowest Rated Drivers**  
A narrow group of drivers sustains ratings above 4.4, indicating consistent service quality. The lowest tier sits below 3.0, marking clear performance gaps.

* **Impact of Driver Experience on Outcomes**  
Lower-experience drivers show marginally higher completion rates and user scores. As ride volume grows, both metrics trend downward, reflecting operational strain rather than skill deficiency.

* **Average Ride Duration by Traffic Conditions**  
Low-traffic periods correlate with the longest trips. High-traffic windows tilt toward shorter, utilitarian routes, reducing average duration despite congestion.

## 4. Operational & Financial Insights

* **Average Fare per Ride Type**  
SUVs sit at the top of the pricing ladder, with Sedans and Electric rides forming the mid-tier. Shared and Motorcycle categories anchor the low-fare segment.

* **Effect of Surge Pricing on Fares and Revenue**  
Surge periods raise the average fare and bring in notable revenue even though fewer rides occur during those times, showing how dynamic pricing strengthens overall earnings.

* **Most Common Payment Methods**  
Credit cards are used most often, with cash still playing a sizable role. Mobile wallets make up the smallest share but remain a consistent option for many riders.

## 5. External Factors Impacting Rides

* **Weather Impact on Duration and Ratings**  
Thunderstorms lead to longer trips and slightly lower ratings, likely due to tougher driving conditions. Clear weather brings the highest number of rides and more stable ratings, while fog, rain, and snow cause only minor changes.

* **Traffic Level Impact on Duration and Fares**  
Low-traffic periods tend to involve longer trips with higher fares, while high-traffic times often involve shorter, less costly rides. The differences point more to the types of trips taken during each period than to traffic alone.
