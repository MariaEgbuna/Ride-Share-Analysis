# Optimizing Ride-Sharing Performance & Customer Experience

![Ride Share](<Images/Ride Share.jpg>)

The goal is to enhance ride efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction. By analyzing **Ride Sharing Dataset**, I uncovered key insights into user behavior, driver performance, and operational bottlenecks. This will allow the ride share platform to make data-driven decisions that drive growth and efficiency.

## Tools Used

* **Excel**: For the initial cleaning process.
* **Python**: For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Data Cleaning and Processing

* Initially, I used **Excel** to correct inconsistent time formats and remove empty rows from the dataset. This ensured that the data was clean and ready for further analysis in Python.

* After importing the dataset using `pandas`, I utilized the `parse_dates` parameter in the `read_csv` function to automatically convert date columns into datetime objects. This ensures accurate time-based analysis and simplifies operations like filtering by date, extracting day of the week, and calculating ride durations.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset and parse date columns
RideShare = pd.read_csv(
    "Dataset/Ride Sharing Data.csv",
    parse_dates= ["Ride DateTime"]
)
```

* After inspection, the dataset was found to have no missing values and no duplicate rows. This allowed for a smoother transition to the analysis phase, as no additional data imputation or deduplication steps were necessary.

## 2. Customer Behavior & Preferences

### What are the most popular pickup and drop-off locations?

``` python
# What are the most popular pickup and drop-off locations?

PopularPickupSpots = RideShare["Pickup Location"].value_counts().head(3)

PopularDropoffSpots = RideShare["Dropoff Location"].value_counts().head(3)

print("The most popular pickup locations are:\n", PopularPickupSpots)

print("\nThe most popular drop-off locations are:\n", PopularDropoffSpots)
```

**Results:**

| Rank | Pickup Location | Count |
|------|----------------|-------|
| 1    | Suburbs        | 1,487 |
| 2    | Mall           | 1,459 |

* Least Popular Route: **Mall → Suburbs (183 rides):** The lowest among the top routes, suggesting less demand for this direction.

**Insights:** Commuting routes between the Financial District and Suburbs are well-balanced, minimizing empty return trips for drivers. Mall traffic is slightly higher inbound than outbound, indicating it is more of a destination than an origin point.

### How do weekends vs. weekdays impact ride demand?

``` python
# Extracting the day of the week from the Ride DateTime Column
RideShare["Day of Week"] = RideShare["Ride DateTime"].dt.day_name()

# How do weekends vs. weekdays impact ride demand?
WeekdayRides = RideShare[RideShare["Day of Week"].isin(["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"])]
WeekendRides = RideShare[RideShare["Day of Week"].isin(["Saturday", "Sunday"])]

# Analyzing the number of rides
print("Weekday Rides:", WeekdayRides.shape[0])
print("Weekend Rides:", WeekendRides.shape[0])
```

**Results:**

| Category        | Ride Count |
|-----------------|------------|
| Weekday Rides | 8,560      |
| Weekend Rides | 1,440      |

**Insight:** The company's financial stability is highly tied to the 5-day work week. The majority of rides occur on weekdays, highlighting a strong commuter-driven demand. Weekend rides account for a smaller share, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions or service adjustments during off-peak periods.

**Insight:** The top-performing drivers consistently maintain ratings above 4.4, reflecting strong customer satisfaction. Conversely, the lowest-rated drivers have ratings below 3.0, indicating areas for targeted coaching or intervention.

* How does driver experience impact ride completion rates and customer ratings?

``` python
# Base Aggregation
DriverExperience = RideShare.groupby("Driver ID").agg(
    TotalRides=("Ride Status", "count"),
    CompletedRides=("Ride Status", lambda x: (x == "Completed").sum()),
    AvgCustomerRating=("User Rating", "mean")
).round(2)

# Add the key performance metric (Completion Rate)
DriverExperience["Completion Rate"] = (
    DriverExperience["CompletedRides"] / DriverExperience["TotalRides"]
).round(3) 

# Define the Tiers (Adjusted for max rides = 15)
bins = [0, 5, 10, 16] 
labels = ['Low Experience', 'Medium Experience', 'High Experience']

DriverExperience["Experience Tier"] = pd.cut(
    DriverExperience["TotalRides"], 
    bins=bins, 
    labels=labels, 
    right=True
)

# Convert the 'Driver ID' index back into a column
DriverExperience = DriverExperience.reset_index()

# Analyze Impact (Group by the new tier)
ExperienceImpact = DriverExperience.groupby("Experience Tier").agg(
    DriverCount=("Driver ID", "count"),
    AvgCompletionRate=("Completion Rate", "mean"),
    AvgUserRating=("AvgCustomerRating", "mean")
).round(3)

print("--- Driver Experience Impact Summary ---")
print(ExperienceImpact.to_markdown(index=True))
```

#### Driver Experience Impact Result Summary

| Experience Tier            | Driver Count | Avg Completion Rate | Avg User Rating |
